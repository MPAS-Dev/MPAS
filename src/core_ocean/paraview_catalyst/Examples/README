To use these scripts, copy mpas_common.py to your working directory (where you
run a core_* executable from) and copy one of the mpas-*.py scripts to a file
named mpas.py. Make any edits to it that are required for the simulation run.
Instructions for the dataset map are available as part of the mpas-example.py
script.
