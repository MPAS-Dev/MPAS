This document describes the format of a template file, which is used to define
a set of namelist and streams configurations that will be used multiple times.

A template file contains information describing how to configure a namelist
and/or a streams file in a standard way. A template file can be applied to
multiple cases, and allows config files for cases to be shorter sicne the
options are defined within the template instead of in the config file.

Below, you will see text describing the various XML tags available in a template
file. Each will describe the tag itself, any attributes the tag can have, and
what children can be placed below the tag.

<template> - This is the overarching parent tag within a template file. It
             begins a template definition.
    Children:
        - <namelist>
        - <streams>

<namelist> - This tag defines a set of namelist modifications that will be
             applied if this template is used within a config file's <namelist>
             tag.
    - Children:
        * <option>

<option> - This tag defines an option that should be modified in the namelist file.
    - Attributes:
        * name: The name of the option that should be modifed
    - Text:
        * The text within <option> and </option> tags will be used to set the
          value of the namelist option.

<streams> - This tag defines a set of streams modifications that will be
            applied if this template is used wtihin a config file's <streams>
            tag.
    - Children:
        * <stream>

<stream> - This tag defines a stream that should be modified / created in the
           streams file.
    - Children:
        * <attribute>
        * <add_contents>
        * <remove_contents>

<attribute> - This tag defines an attribute that should be created / modified
              in a stream definition.
    - Attributes:
        * name: The name of the stream attribute to modify / define
    - Text:
        * The text in between the <attribute> and </attribute> tags will be
          used to set the value of the attribute.

<add_contents> - This tag defines a list of members to add to a stream definition
    - Children:
        * <member>

<remove_contents> - This tag defines a list of members to remove from a stream definition
    - Children:
        * <member>

<member> - This tag defines a member that should be added or removed from a stream definition.
    - Attributes:
        * name: The name of the member that will be defined. If this is in an
                <add_contents> tag, it will be added to the stream, if it is in a
                <remove_contents> tag, it will be removed from the stream.
        * type: The type of the member to add (This is ignored if it's within a
                <remove_contents> tag). Example values are var, var_array,
                var_struct, and stream.
